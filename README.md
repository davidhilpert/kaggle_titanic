# Titanic Competition

This project is my version of the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic), which is a fun exercise to try out machine learning (ML) techniques. The challenge is to accurately predict passenger survival based on a relatively crisp dataframe compiled from the passenger list. 

In this project, I try out some ideas concerning feature engineering and ML models. My most powerful model achieves a test set accuracy of 97.4%.
